Building and running:

1. ensure the dartc compiler is built:
  $ cd dart/
  $ ./tools/build.py --arch=ia32

2. run the update.py script:
  $ cd samples/swarm/
  $ python update.py

3. To run on App Engine, install the App Engine SDK for your platform, then
  $ easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client per http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/wiki/Installation
  $ cd samples/swarm/appengine
  $ enable-app-engine-project . per http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/wiki/GoogleAppEngine
  Start the App Engine dev server and browse to /swarm-js.html

4. To run without App Engine (demo only, no feeds), open the generated file in a browser:
  $ google-chrome ../../outcode/swarm-js.html
