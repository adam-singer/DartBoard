/**
 * Basic input stream which supplies binary data.
 *
 * Input streams are used to read data sequentially from some data
 * source. All input streams are non-blocking. They each have a number
 * of read calls which will always return without any IO related
 * blocking. If the requested data is not available a read call will
 * return [:null:]. All input streams have one or more handlers which
 * will trigger when data is available.
 *
 * The following example shows a data handler in an ordinary input
 * stream which will be called when some data is available and a call
 * to read will not return [:null:].
 *
 * [:
 *    InputStream input = ...
 *    input.dataHandler = () {
 *      var data = input.read();
 *      ...
 *    };
 * :]
 *
 * If for some reason the data from an input stream cannot be handled
 * by the application immediately setting the data handler to [:null:]
 * will avoid further callbacks until it is set to a function
 * again. While the data handler is not active system flow control
 * will be used to avoid buffering more data than needed.
 *
 * Always set up appropriate handlers when using input streams.
 *
